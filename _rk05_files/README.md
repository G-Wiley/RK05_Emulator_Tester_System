Files in this folder can be copied to a microSD card that the emulator will load. When the RUN/LOAD switch is toggled to the RUN position, the emulator loads the first rk05 file that it finds on the microSD card.<p>
os8.rk05 is a bootable image of OS8<p>
scratch.rk05 is a scratch disk, meaning that it has a valid empty file allocation table so OS8 will recognize it as a disk with no files on it.<p>
