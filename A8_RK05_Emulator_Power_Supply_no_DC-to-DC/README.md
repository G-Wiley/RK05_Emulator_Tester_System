# RK05 Emulator Power Supply no DC-to-DC

"A8_RK05_Emulator_Power_Supply_no_DC-to-DC" is a subset of "A7_RK05_Emulator_Power_Supply". 
The same PCB is used for A7 and A8. Refer to the folder "A7_RK05_Emulator_Power_Supply" for the Gerber file and schematic.

Note that on PCB v1, the silkscreen text for "+5V" and "GND" by J13 and J11 are reversed from what they should be. The intended legends are:
J11 should be "+5V"
J13 should be "GND"
